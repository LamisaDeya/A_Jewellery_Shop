# A Jewellery Shop Website

## Overview
This project is an e-commerce website for a Jewellery Shop, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **ASP.NET Framework**. It consists of an **Admin Panel**, **User Panel**, and a **Default Panel** where visitors can browse products without registering. The website dynamically updates based on admin input, and users can manage their shopping experience through features like sorting, cart management, and subscriptions.

## Features

### Admin Panel
- **Category Management**: Admin can add, update, or delete product categories, subcategories, and brand names.
- **Product Management**: Admin can add new products with details like images, categories, subcategories, and brands. Products can be edited or deleted as needed.
- **Inventory Management**: Admin can track product quantities, and when a product runs out of stock, it becomes unavailable for users to purchase.
- **Order Management**: Admin can view user orders and update the order status from "Pending" to "Done" upon delivery. Automated emails are sent to users when an order is received and when it is delivered.
- **Subscriber Management**: Admin can view the list of email subscribers and send them automated messages about new products or offers.
- **Automatic Email Notifications**: The system sends email notifications to users when their order status changes and when new offers or products are added.
- **Product Quantity Tracking**: For every product purchase, the system reduces the quantity. If the quantity reaches zero, the product becomes unavailable for purchase.

### User Panel
- **Product Browsing**: Users can view products dynamically displayed based on admin input. They can sort products in various ways:
  - Alphabetically (ascending/descending)
  - Date-wise (newest/oldest)
  - Price-wise (lowest/highest)
- **Product Search and Filtering**: Users can search and filter products by category, subcategory, or brand via dropdown menus.
- **Cart Management**: Users can add products to their cart, view the total cost, and manage quantities. They can:
  - Add or remove products
  - Increase or decrease product quantities
- **Session & Cookies**: Each userâ€™s cart is stored in the session, so users can only view and manage their own cart.
- **Checkout Process**: Users can proceed to checkout, fill in their details, and make a payment. Upon checkout, an email confirmation is sent to the user.
- **Subscription**: Users can subscribe using their email to receive notifications about new products and offers. Subscribers get automated emails with product links.

### Default Panel
